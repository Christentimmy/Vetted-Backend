## Required Actions Before Going Live

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Update Stripe Configuration

1. **Create Top-Up Product in Stripe Dashboard**
   ```
   - Login to Stripe Dashboard
   - Navigate to Products ‚Üí Create Product
   - Name: "Feature Top-Up"
   - Description: "Add 1 request to each premium feature"
   - Price: $2.99 USD
   - Payment type: One-time
   - Copy the Price ID (starts with price_...)
   ```

2. **Update Feature Limits Config**
   
   Edit `src/config/feature_limits.ts`:
   ```typescript
   export const FEATURE_LIMITS = {
     SUBSCRIPTION_INITIAL_LIMIT: 5,
     TOP_UP_LIMIT: 1,
     TOP_UP_PRICE: 2.99,
     TOP_UP_PRICE_ID: 'price_YOUR_ACTUAL_STRIPE_PRICE_ID', // ‚ö†Ô∏è UPDATE THIS
   };
   ```

### üîÑ Optional: Adjust Limits

If you want different limits, edit `src/config/feature_limits.ts`:

```typescript
export const FEATURE_LIMITS = {
  SUBSCRIPTION_INITIAL_LIMIT: 10, // Change from 5 to 10
  TOP_UP_LIMIT: 2,                // Give 2 requests instead of 1
  TOP_UP_PRICE: 4.99,             // Change price
  TOP_UP_PRICE_ID: 'price_...',
};
```

## Testing in Development

### 1. Test Subscription Flow
```bash
# User subscribes
POST /api/subscription/create

# Check feature usage (should show 5 for each feature)
GET /api/subscription/feature-usage

# Use a premium feature (e.g., criminal search)
POST /api/app-service/enformion-criminal-search

# Check again (should show 4 for that feature)
GET /api/subscription/feature-usage
```

### 2. Test Top-Up Flow
```bash
# Request top-up checkout
POST /api/subscription/top-up

# Complete payment in Stripe
# (Use test card: 4242 4242 4242 4242)

# Check feature usage (all features should increment by 1)
GET /api/subscription/feature-usage
```

### 3. Test Feature Limit Enforcement
```bash
# Use a feature 5 times until it reaches 0
# The 6th request should return 403 with message to top up
```

## Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Test subscription creation in Stripe test mode
- [ ] Test top-up payment in Stripe test mode
- [ ] Verify webhook events are received correctly
- [ ] Test feature usage tracking
- [ ] Test limit enforcement (reaching 0 requests)
- [ ] Test subscription renewal resets limits
- [ ] Update client app to show feature usage
- [ ] Update client app to show top-up option
- [ ] Deploy to production
- [ ] Switch Stripe to live mode
- [ ] Monitor webhook events in production
- [ ] Test with real payment

---

## Client Integration Points

### 1. Display Feature Usage
```typescript
// Call this endpoint to show user their remaining requests
GET /api/subscription/feature-usage

// Response example:
{
  "featureUsage": {
    "enformionCriminalSearch": 3,
    "enformionNumberSearch": 5,
    "nameLookup": 2,
    // ...
  }
}
```

### 2. Handle "Out of Requests" Error
```typescript
// When API returns 403 for a premium feature:
{
  "message": "No requests remaining for this feature",
  "feature": "enformionCriminalSearch",
  "details": {
    "topUpPrice": 2.99,
    "suggestion": "Purchase a top-up for $2.99..."
  }
}

// Show top-up purchase button
```

### 3. Top-Up Purchase
```typescript
// Create checkout session
POST /api/subscription/top-up

// Response:
{
  "checkoutUrl": "https://checkout.stripe.com/...",
  "sessionId": "cs_..."
}

// Redirect user to checkoutUrl
```

### 4. Success Redirect
Update success URL in client:
```
/subscription/top-up-success?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}
```

## Monitoring & Analytics

### Key Metrics to Track

1. **Feature Usage per User**
   - Which features are used most?
   - Average requests per billing cycle

2. **Top-Up Conversion Rate**
   - How many users buy top-ups?
   - When do they typically run out?

3. **Revenue Analysis**
   - Subscription revenue vs top-up revenue
   - Average revenue per user (ARPU)

### Database Queries

```javascript
// Find users running low on requests
db.users.find({
  "subscription.status": "active",
  $or: [
    { "featureUsage.enformionCriminalSearch": { $lte: 1 } },
    { "featureUsage.nameLookup": { $lte: 1 } },
    // ... other features
  ]
})

// Count top-up purchases this month
// (Check Stripe dashboard or query payment metadata)
```

---

## Rollback Plan

If you need to revert to unlimited access:

1. **Comment out feature limit checks in `pro_checker.ts`**:
   ```typescript
   // Quick rollback: just check subscription status
   if (hasActiveSubscription) {
     next();
     return;
   }
   ```

2. **Keep the new endpoints** (they won't break anything)

3. **Remove from client** any UI showing feature usage

---

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Issue: Feature limits not resetting on renewal
- Check webhook is receiving `invoice.payment_succeeded`
- Verify `handleSubscriptionUpdated()` is called
- Check database: user.featureUsage should update

### Issue: Top-up payment not adding requests
- Check webhook received `checkout.session.completed`
- Verify metadata.type === 'top_up'
- Check `handleTopUpPayment()` executed successfully

### Issue: User sees "Invalid premium feature access"
- Check `ROUTE_TO_FEATURE_MAP` includes the route
- Verify route path matches exactly (including `/api/app-service/`)

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Complete Stripe product setup
2. ‚úÖ Update configuration with real Price ID
3. ‚úÖ Test in development
4. ‚úÖ Update client app UI
5. ‚úÖ Deploy and test in production
6. üìä Monitor usage and adjust limits as needed
7. üí∞ Analyze revenue impact

**Ready to go!** The system is fully implemented and production-ready once you complete the Stripe configuration.
